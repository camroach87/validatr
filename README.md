## Idea

Fits various models on training sets and calculates accuracy measures. Lots of packages have cross-validation functionality, but it's not very useful if you want to compare a model fit with a different package's method. The intention of this package is to allow for all other package methods to be assessed under identical conditions.

## Example

Aiming for ease of use. Note that it is necessary to have the Model and Prediction strings in the same order. While not a big deal, I would like to set things up to be more general and less prone to error in the future.

A contrived, but hopefully illuminating example is given below. Here, four separate models from two different packages are fit to each fold's training data. The accuracy of each measure is then calculated on each fold's validation data.

```{r}
require(randomForest)

kfold_cv(iris, k = 10) %>%
  fit_models("LM1 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train)",
             "LM2 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Width, data = train)",
             "RF1 = randomForest(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, ntree = 10)",
             "RF2 = randomForest(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, ntree = 500)") %>%
  calc_predictions("LM1 = predict(LM1, newdata = validation)",
                   "LM2 = predict(LM2, newdata = validation)",
                   "RF1 = predict(RF1, newdata = validation)",
                   "RF2 = predict(RF2, newdata = validation)") %>%
  calc_accuracy(y = "Sepal.Length", yhat = c("LM1", "LM2", "RF1", "RF2"),
                average_folds = TRUE)
```
Other improvements planned:

* Remove all those awful quotes - need to learn more about NSE!
* Set up `fit_models` and `calc_predictions` functions so that strings do not need to be in same order. Code should be able to detect which model prediction expressions/strings are referring to. Maybe specify `Model1 = ` instead of `Prediction1 = ` for consistency?
* Remove the need to specify `y = "Sepal.Length"` since we should already know "Sepal.Length" was used as the response. Similarly for `yhat` since the model names have already been input.
