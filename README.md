Fits various models on training sets and calculates accuracy measures. Lots of packages have cross-validation functionality, but it's not very useful if you want to compare a model fit with a different package's method. The intention of this package is to allow for all other package methods to be assessed under identical conditions.

## Installation

From your R console, simply run:

```{r}
install.packages("devtools")
require(devtools)
devtools::install_github("camroach87/validatr")
```

## Usage

Essentially, validatr works by first creating a `validatr` object which contains the cross-validation data. Three verbs are then used to carry out regression, time-series or classification analysis:

* `model()` fits models to each training set.
* `predict()` calculates predictions on each validation dataset.
* `assess()` calculates accuracy measures.

Furthermore, the accuracy measures can be visualised using the `autoplot()` function. To fit and assess two models, the code would follow the below structure.

```{r}
data %>% 
  validatr(y = <Dependent variable name>) %>% 
  model(<Model 1 name> = <Code to fit model 1 on train data>,
        <Model 2 name> = <Code to fit model 2 on train data>) %>% 
  predict(<Model 1 name> = <Code to return vector of predictions>,
          <Model 2 name> = <Code to return vector of predictions>) %>% 
  assess() %>% 
  autoplot()
```

__Important:__ Make sure that the model names are consistent all the way through. For example, don't call something `LM1` in the `model` function and then `Prediction_LM1` in the `predict` function. The code will fail in weird and mysterious ways which I have not yet explored. There are no plans to allow for this functionality as I believe this will make the code more difficult to use without really adding substantial benefits.

## Examples

Examples for regression, time-series and classification analysis are given below. 

### Regression

A contrived, but hopefully illuminating example is given below. Here, four separate models from two different packages are fit to each fold's training data. The accuracy of each measure is then calculated on each fold's validation data.


```{r}
require(validatr)
require(randomForest)

iris %>% 
  validatr(y = Sepal.Length, k = 10) %>%
  model(LM1 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train),
        LM2 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Width, data = train),
        RF1 = randomForest(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, ntree = 10),
        RF2 = randomForest(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train, ntree = 500)) %>%
  predict(LM1 = predict(LM1, newdata = validation),
          LM2 = predict(LM2, newdata = validation),
          RF1 = predict(RF1, newdata = validation),
          RF2 = predict(RF2, newdata = validation)) %>%
  assess()

```

### Time-series

This approach can be adopted for time-series forecasting. If `data_type` is set to "ts", time-series cross-validation will be carried out. Additionally, the Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE) is also calculated. The time-series cross-validation parameters are:

* `start` is the start of the first fold.
* `horizon` is the length of the fold. 
* `shift` is the length of time to move forward.
* `ts` is the name of the variable containing time-series data.

Note that in `predict` a bit of work needs to be done to ensure `Arima()` returns a numeric vector of predictions.

```{r}
require(forecast)
require(lubridate)

data <- data.frame(Date = dmy(paste("1/1/", as.numeric(time(nhtemp)))),
                   Temperature = as.numeric(nhtemp))

data %>% 
  validatr(y = Temperature, ts = Date, data_type = "ts", 
           start = dmy("1/1/1960"), horizon = "3 years",
           shift = "1 year") %>% 
  model(ARIMA = Arima(train$Temperature),
        AA = auto.arima(train$Temperature),
        LM = lm(Temperature ~ Date, data = train)) %>% 
  predict(ARIMA = as.numeric(forecast(ARIMA, h = nrow(validation))$mean),
          AA = as.numeric(forecast(AA, h = 3)$mean),
          LM = predict(LM, newdata = validation),
          Benchmark = mean(train$Temperature)) %>% 
  assess() %>% 
  autoplot()
```

### Classification

Binary and multi-class models can be assessed. If the response variable is a Boolean binary classification measures will be calculated by `assess()`. Positives are denoted by `TRUE` and negatives by `FALSE`. Otherwise, as long as three or more classes are present multi-class measures are calculated.

```{r}
require(validatr)
require(MASS)
require(randomForest)

iris %>% 
  validatr(y = Species, data_type = "classification", k = 5) %>%
  model(LDA = lda(Species ~ ., data = train),
        QDA = qda(Species ~ ., data = train),
        RF = randomForest(Species ~ ., data = train)) %>%
  predict(LDA = predict(LDA, newdata = validation)$class,
          QDA = predict(QDA, newdata = validation)$class,
          RF = predict(RF, newdata = validation)) %>%
  assess() %>% 
  autoplot()
```

## Benchmark models

Benchmark models can also be included by adding them in the `predict()` function and using the `train` dataset.

```{r}
iris %>% 
  validatr(Sepal.Length, k = 3) %>%
  model(Model1 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ ., data = train),
        Model2 = lm(Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width + Petal.Width, data = train)) %>%
  predict(Model1 = predict(Model1, newdata = validation),
          Model2 = predict(Model2, newdata = validation),
          Benchmark_median = median(train$Sepal.Length),
          Benchmark_mean = mean(train$Sepal.Length)) %>% 
  assess() %>% 
  autoplot()
```


## Future development

* Quantile forecast accuracy measures, e.g., pinball loss.
* Parallelisation. Embarrassingly parallel. Just send every list element/model to a separate cpu.
* Allow greater verb flexibility. `assess()` should behave differently if it is used after `validatr()` or `model()` functions. If used after `validatr()` maybe it can assess the data for null values or any other issues. Not sure what it could do after `model()`, but something to think about.


## Caveat

As this package is in early development there may be errors and bugs that render your analysis invalid. The irony is not lost on the author.
